<h1>Why a Fourth Musketeer Isn't Needed.</h1>
<p>The three musketeers is a tale known by all ages, and even though the generation of today does not have a premier acess to a Three Musketeer film... Kids who grew up in the 2000's or parents that raised children during the time, definetely did. The is a large variety of films for this story. But do any of those iconic movies need a fourth cast member? No. </p>

<p>I would like to think that the 1993 film of the three musketeers is an essential movie for this discussion. Although it it a 90's production, some early 2000's kids might remember this movie as a fever dream. A movie their parent's put on vhs and left on over night. I think it is a great production and it sticks true to it's origin story. This being said, no fourth membe ris needed as it would break away from the parallel to the original tale. </p>

<p>Now, it is to no surprise that disney decided to tackle this story as their own. Using Mickey, Goofy and Donald Duck as their cast members, their production of this film is top tier. A fourth member would not make this movie work since this is aleady an iconic trio outside the film. Adding a fourth wheel to this amazing trycicle would harm the aesthetic of the movie.</p>

<p>Barbie Movies! A quite contreversial topic of the oast, but a very important keystone to early 2000's culture. Barbie has been through a lot, but we have to give kudos to this movie. Having three female protagonist portraying an originally male story line is a huge power ove. This aimed to show girls that they don't need to be princesses. They could wield a swords and kick some butt just as good as boys can (if not beeter!). A fourth barbie would not be necessary as it would distract the audience from barbie- the icon of this franchise. </p>
